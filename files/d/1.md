Welcome! Here's everything you need to know to get started with the documentation system.

s
To set up your documentation:

1. Add markdown files to the `files/` folder
2. Create an `index.md` for your main documentation hub
3. Add any additional `.md` files as separate sections

## File Structure

```
files/
├── index.md          (Main documentation)
├── getting-started.md
├── installation.md
└── configuration.md
```

## Best Practices

- Keep your `index.md` concise and use it as an overview
- Use other `.md` files for detailed sections
- Organize related content together
- Use descriptive titles and headings
